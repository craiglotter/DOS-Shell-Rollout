DOS-Shell-Rollout
=================

The problem in managing a large number of PCs is keeping them all uptodate and uniform in terms of the software provided on them. In most instances this is managed through a process of imaging, using various existing software solutions. However, rolling out images is particularly tedious, especially across large networks and for small inconsequential changes. DOS Shell Rollout provides a simple solution to providing for temporary updates to all networked PCs without having to rollout images. Created by Craig Lotter, November 2005
